                <h2>I received a job offer mid-course, and subjects I learned were current,if not more so,in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny's worth.</h2>
                <p>"I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly theafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've sucessfully switched carrers, working as a Software Enginner at a VR startup. "</p>
